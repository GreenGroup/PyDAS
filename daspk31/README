DASPK 3.1
Large Scale Differential Algebraic Equation Solver with Sensitivity Analysis

Before using, dump the files from the DASPK 3.1 source code into this folder. 
You can use the script download_daspk31.sh to automatically download and unpack the source files
or download it manually from the web here: http://www.engineering.ucsb.edu/~cse/software.html 

The following files should be present in the 'solver' folder:
    adf_dummy.f
    daux.f
    ddaskr.f
    ddaspk.f
    dlinpk.f
    dsensd.f
    mpi_dummy.f

Making the PyDAS package will compile the fortran code as well as PyDAS wrappers.  
Use the 'make daspk31' command in the parent folder to compile the fortran code for
daspk31 only.
