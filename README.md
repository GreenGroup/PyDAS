# PyDAS
## Python Wrapper to DASPK, DASSL, and DASKR

> [!WARNING]  
> PyDAS is no longer receiving updates. The ReactionMechanismGenerator organization has no developers capable of maintaining it.

The usage documentation is still relevant but no new updates will be released and we are unable to fix any bugs.
We will continue to release conda packages for PyDAS as long as possible.

To build PyDAS, clone this repository, install the dependencies (find them with `conda search -c rmg pydas`), upgrade whichever are causing problems, then navigate to the `.conda` directory and run `conda build .`.
Installation instructions in the documentation directory are _not_ up to date.

The original README file is maintained in this repository, for posterity.
